# **Why are you here** is it because
## **Don't take any of my items**

- You want my attention
- You are trying to steal my code
- Or you are just odd and want to view peoples things
- I'm not evil I'm actually quite nice I think I don't do anything to make anyone dislike me besides myself.
- You don't know what I'm talking about do you.
- They put an RFID chip inside of my head so they could track me at all times
- I have blocked all the microphones that are around me and have taken out every camera they wont find me
- They have taken millions of people without a reason and I'm going to be next I've seen an alien.
- They don't want to take me because they are scared of me I think.
