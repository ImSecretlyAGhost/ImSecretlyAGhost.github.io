        <h3>Czech Neighborhoods in Chicago</h3>
        <p>
            Czech immigrants primarily settled in neighborhoods such as Pilsen, Cicero, and Lawndale. Pilsen, originally a predominantly Czech community, became a hub for Czech culture, featuring language schools, bakeries, and churches that preserved traditions brought from Bohemia. Cicero and Lawndale also attracted Czech families who sought work in manufacturing and trades. Many of these neighborhoods developed tight-knit communities where social clubs, religious institutions, and cultural events reinforced a shared identity. Czech immigrants often lived in multi-generational households, allowing traditions to be passed down and maintained despite the pressures of assimilation.

        <p>
            Churches such as St. Wenceslaus and St. Procopius became central to community life, offering not only religious services but also cultural education. Social organizations like Sokol clubs promoted physical education, social interaction, and cultural pride. Through these institutions, Czech Americans preserved language, music, and customs while gradually integrating into the larger Chicago community. The imprint of these neighborhoods remains visible today in architecture, local businesses, and cultural festivals.
