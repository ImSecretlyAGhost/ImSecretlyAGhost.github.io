    <div class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Twentieth Ward of Chicago, particularly the blocks between Sixteenth and Eighteenth streets and Union to Burlington, was predominantly inhabited by Slovaks. This district represented a newer wave of Slavic immigration, with Slovaks occupying one-third of households, along with Lithuanians, Bohemians, and Poles. The area had a long history of poor infrastructure and overcrowding.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Housing and Population</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Total households surveyed: 854</li>
            <li>Children under 12: ~32% of the population</li>
            <li>Adult lodgers: 13%</li>
            <li>Population density: Average 287 persons per acre</li>
            <li>Most houses: 1–2 stories, under 5 apartments each</li>
            <li>Majority of houses (73%) were frame structures, old, and in disrepair</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Sanitation and Toilets</h2>
        <p>Toilet facilities were inadequate and often shared by multiple families:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Location of Toilet</th>
                    <th>Number of Families Using</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Yard</td>
                    <td>201</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Cellar</td>
                    <td>285</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Under sidewalk</td>
                    <td>209</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Hall</td>
                    <td>72</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Privacy and convenience were major issues, especially for the sick, elderly, or families with children.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Overcrowding and Apartment Conditions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>53% of sleeping rooms were overcrowded according to legal standards</li>
            <li>Ceilings often below legal height; cellars and basements were damp and unhealthy</li>
            <li>Windows inadequate for light and ventilation; many opened onto lot-lines or passages</li>
            <li>Boarders often worsened overcrowding and lack of privacy</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Rents and Ownership</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Median rent for a four-room apartment: $9–$9.50, comparable to South Chicago workers</li>
            <li>17% of apartments owned by occupants; the remainder rented</li>
            <li>Tenancy duration linked to ownership: 37% of owners lived in their homes for over 15 years</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Residents of the Slovak district faced long-term challenges including overcrowding, poor sanitation, inadequate ventilation, and old, deteriorating housing. These conditions highlight systemic issues in urban housing for immigrant populations in early 20th century Chicago.</p>
