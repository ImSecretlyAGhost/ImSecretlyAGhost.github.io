<h3>Language Impacts</h3>
<p>
Czech is, in my opinion, a beautiful language, though it does have its imperfections. I love how it sounds, even if some of the words can seem a bit unusual at first. One of the most interesting letters in Czech is ř, which requires you to roll your tongue slightly when pronouncing it. You don’t have to roll it, but that’s how it’s traditionally spoken. Personally, I can’t roll my tongue very well, so I tend to pronounce it more like a regular r.</p>

Another fascinating thing about Czech culture is their strong tradition of winemaking, as well as the beautiful scenery found throughout the country. To truly appreciate some of these places and their stories, knowing the language definitely helps. Historically, when the region was known as Bohemia, the language was still called Czech, which shows just how deeply rooted it is in their identity.</p>

The language and movies they've created have been amazing and I do ot regret learning the language if I could learn all the information I've learned so far I would but that would take way too long and I really cannot spend time like that again but I've personally always been the type of person to never give up on the things I like and I really feel as if I were to learn a language again and start all over again my first language I'd learn would be czech </p>
